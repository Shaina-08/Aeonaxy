# Aeonaxy Assignment: React Form App



## Description
This project is a React application designed to create a user registration form with validation and conditional rendering features. It allows users to input their username, email, password, and confirm password, with validation checks ensuring the correctness of the input data. Additionally, users are prompted to agree to terms and conditions via a checkbox. The form submission triggers a success toast message upon successful registration, or an error toast message if validation fails. The About component, integral to this application, orchestrates form submission, validation, and seamless navigation upon successful submission. It offers an array of form fields, each with relevant questions and selects, dynamically adjusting based on user input.
